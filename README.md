RECOMMENDATIONS
From my analysis, I observed the following:
Students in public schools did better than their private school counterparts and this could be as a result of the poor quality of teachers hired in private schools. I recommend that the measures or yardsticks for private school recruitment be reviewed to conform with that of the public schools to enable them employ more qualified teachers.
Students with high and low parent involvement are likely to perform poorly. I recommend that parents participate actively but their involvement and participation should be carefully guided by the school authorities.
Students with negative peer group should be sensitized to desist from such association because it clearly affects their class performance.
The female students should be given extra attention in order to bring them up to speed with their male counterparts because it seems, they are lagging behind.
Students who study for very long hours and very short hours should be sensitized about the importance of moderation in their study activities.
Tutoring hours should be fixed in moderation to avoid overburdening or under burdening the students
